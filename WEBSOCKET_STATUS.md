# WebSocket Status and Error Handling

## Current Status

The WordPress Website Generator currently **does not have a WebSocket server implementation**. The frontend code attempts to connect to a WebSocket endpoint (`/ws`) that doesn't exist on the server.

## Error Messages You're Seeing

When you see errors like:
```
WebSocket error occurred
{ "isTrusted": true }
```

This is **expected behavior** and not a real error. These are browser-generated WebSocket connection events that occur when the WebSocket server is not available.

## How It Works Now

1. **WebSocket Connection Attempt**: The app tries to connect to WebSocket for real-time updates
2. **Connection Failure**: Since no WebSocket server exists, the connection fails
3. **Fallback to Polling**: The app automatically falls back to HTTP polling for progress updates
4. **Normal Operation**: Website generation continues normally using polling

## Error Handling Improvements

The app has been updated to:

- ✅ **Detect WebSocket availability** before attempting connection
- ✅ **Suppress error toasts** for expected WebSocket connection failures
- ✅ **Provide informative debug messages** explaining the fallback behavior
- ✅ **Continue normal operation** using HTTP polling instead of WebSockets

## Debug Panel Information

When WebSocket errors occur, the debug panel will show:
```
WebSocket server not available, using polling fallback
Note: WebSocket errors are expected when the server doesn't support WebSockets. The app will use polling instead.
```

## What This Means for You

- **No action required**: The app works perfectly without WebSockets
- **Progress updates still work**: Via HTTP polling every 2 seconds
- **No error toasts**: WebSocket connection failures are handled silently
- **Better debugging**: Clear information about what's happening

## Future Implementation

If you want to add WebSocket support in the future, you would need to:

1. Implement a WebSocket server (e.g., using Node.js, Python, or PHP with WebSocket libraries)
2. Handle the `/ws` endpoint with session management
3. Send real-time progress updates through the WebSocket connection

For now, the HTTP polling approach works well and provides the same functionality with slightly higher latency.
